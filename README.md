# purchases-app
Basic "Purchases" page with Next JS with specific styling. The theme of this project is a basic demo of a "Purchases" page that performs the following:
- loads an HTML page at route /purchases
- page should load data sourced from the following [API endpoint](https://storage.googleapis.com/marketplace-prod-7728-shop-cdn-e5e2/interview/data.json)
- data should be rendered in the following responsive layout:
    - mobile
    - desktop
- the page should generally be functional and performant, and free of any UX issues


## Getting Started

First, ensure you have [node and npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) on you local environment.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/purchases](http://localhost:3000/purchases) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
